So mum, the command line is a way of telling a computer to do things using text. It might sound a bit complicated and difficult when you have a mouse and windows you can see, but the command line is way more powerful and lets you do things you otherwise couldn't.

The ten commands in plain English:
1. cd changes the folder you are in to another one.
2. ls lists all the files in a folder.
3. cp copies a file. You have to tell the computer where to put the copy.
4. mv moves a file somewhere else. It can also rename a file.
5. rm deletes a file. If you want to delete a whole folder, you have to put -r after it.
6. pwd tells you which folder you are in at the moment.
7. mkdir creates a folder. You have to give it a name.
8. ~ takes you to your "home" folder, eg. /home/rich
9. cat takes the text inside a file and displays it in your command line program so that you can read it.
10. grep looks for inside files for lines that match a pattern that you specify. It then displays all of the results for you to read.
